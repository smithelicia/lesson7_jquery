### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. hide() and show(): I enjoyed learning these jQuery effects, no matter how simplistic. When combined with an button and an event listening, when clicked, the hide() method will hide the objects selected, and the show() method will display the objects selected.
2. Event methods: Event methods attach a function to an event handler. So, for example, the click() method triggers the click event, or attaches a function to run when the click event has occurred.
3. jQuery and CSS: jQuery uses CSS selectors to select and modify elements. Elements like "background-color" that we learned in web design can be edited using the css() method.
